## Overview

This is a simple utility that runs on Android, and that allows the user to connect to a remote bluetooth device (such as a robot)
and control it via a series of toggles, buttons, and joysticks. 

This only works on Android v15 and higher.

Settings can be found in the settings tab, where you specify the Bluetooth parameters and the strings that should be sent when the different buttons and toggles are activated.
